Twenty Films
============

### A simple way to share and discover new films.


#### Details 
The idea is quite simple, users craft a list of their favorite twenty films.
Users follow other users to keep up with their lists.  Users have access to most
of the film data through the Open Movie Database API, however, users can also
add new films and they will be availible to add to lists.


#### Technology
This is a Backbone.js app writen in CoffeScript and built on a Rails Api.  The
search capabilities were build using Ajax requests to various third party Apis. 
For styling and UI, I used Skeleton, Sass, JQuery, and JQuery Ui.  Other
technologies used include Redis cacheing, and OAuth login through Facebook.
